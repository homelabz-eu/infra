### Kubernetes Cluster Topology

| Cluster | Distribution | Provisioning | Purpose | Infrastructure | Key Platform Components |
|---------|--------------|--------------|---------|----------------|-------------------------|
| dev | Talos Linux | Cluster API | Development environment | 1 CP + 2 workers (dynamic) | Istio service mesh, ArgoCD, development workloads |
| prod | kubeadm | Cluster API | Production services | 1 CP + 2 workers (dynamic) | Istio service mesh, ArgoCD, production applications |
| tools | K3s | Legacy Ansible | Platform infrastructure & Cluster API management cluster | k8s-tools (single node) | Cluster API operator, CloudNativePG, Redis, NATS, Vault, Harbor, MinIO, CI/CD runners (GitHub/GitLab), ArgoCD, Falco |
| home | K3s | Legacy Ansible | Home automation | k8s-home (single node) | Immich photo management, External Secrets |
| observability | K3s | Legacy Ansible | Central telemetry hub | k8s-observability (single node) | Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Loki, OpenTelemetry Collector |
| toolz | RKE2 | Cluster API | Platform workloads + CKS platform | 1 CP + 2 workers | Vault, Harbor, ArgoCD, PostgreSQL, runners, KubeVirt, Longhorn, cks-terminal-mgmt |
| pr-* (ephemeral) | K3s | Cluster API | Temporary PR test environments | Single node per PR (dynamic, 5 max concurrent) | cert-manager, external-dns, external-secrets, CloudNativePG, application under test |

**Note**: dev and prod clusters are managed by Cluster API operator running on tools cluster. Talos provides immutable infrastructure, while kubeadm offers standard Kubernetes. Legacy clusters (clustermgmt, home, observability) provisioned via Proxmox/Ansible workflow. Ephemeral clusters are automatically created per PR in application repositories and destroyed when PR closes.
